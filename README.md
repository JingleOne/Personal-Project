# Personal-Project
Personal projects that I created during my own free time. Come check it out!

The pathfinding project uses the A* search algorithm to get the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point.
It uses Python libraries including Pygame, Tkinter, and regular expression. Tkinter was used to obtain user input for the 
start and endpoint. Regular expression was used to ensure the format and validity of the user inputs, and the Pygame library
was used to create a nice visualization for the pathfinding algorithm. 
The nodes that are red are either explored, or they are the start or endpoint. The nodes that are green are the nodes that are organized
in a priority queue which will get explored soon. 


The sudoku project utilized the backtracking algorithm to obtain the correct answer for each grid on the board. This project has a nice 
and intuitive color scheme that users will know that it means. For example, the grid will flash blue when the user clicks on that grid. Invalid 
answers on a grid will have a background color of red. Valid answers will have green bg color. When players press on the "solve for me" button, 
the auto solve will show players which number on that grid is selected, and whether that number is valid. The auto solver will also show the process
of backtracking when the answer it selects is invalid.
